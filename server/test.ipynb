After tracking to a better-than-expected 2.8% real GDP growth in 2023, we forecast a below-trend 0.93% pace of expansion in 2024.

    "We expect real GDP growth to walk the line between a slight expansion and contraction for much of next year, also known as a soft landing. After tracking to a better-than-expected 2.8% real GDP growth in 2023, we forecast a below-trend 0.93% pace of expansion in 2024. Among the major components of GDP, consumer spending is likely to rise at a more muted pace next year, while fiscal spending could swing from a positive contributor in 2023 to a modest drag. Notable drops in business investment and housing activity in 2023 set the foundation for improved performance in 2024, even if the outlook remains muted amid higher interest rates; 2023 strength in services sector is likely to soften.\n",
    "2. We assume the hiking cycle is over, leaving the Fed Funds on hold at 5.25%-5.5% until the middle of 2024.\n",
    "If inflation continues its moderating trajectory over the coming quarters, we think it is likely the FOMC will start to slowly normalize policy rates near the midpoint of next year. We forecast 25 bps cuts at each meeting beginning in June, bringing the Fed Funds target range to 4.00%-4.25% at the end of 2024. Concurrently, quantitative tightening, the Fed’s balance sheet runoff program, is expected to be maintained at the same pace through 2024. At $95 billion per month, quantitative tightening is projected to remove approximately $1 trillion from the economy next year.\n",
    "3. The U.S. consumer could begin to bend, but not break.\n",
    "There are numerous reasons to expect consumer spending growth to slow next year from its firm pace in 2023: diminished excess savings, plateauing wage gains, low savings rates and less pent-up demand. Additionally, the restart of student loan payments and uptick in subprime auto and millennial credit card delinquencies are emerging signs of stress for some consumers. On the flipside, household balance sheets and debt servicing levels remain healthy. Tight labor markets continue to support employment and therefore income levels. Considering the cross currents, we think consumer spending growth can stay positive overall in 2024, but at a lower rate than 2023.\n",
    "4. The larger-than-expected fiscal boost to the U.S. economy in 2023 could flip to a slight headwind in 2024.\n",
    "The fiscal deficit roughly doubled to $1.84 trillion—7.4% of GDP—in fiscal 2023 from $950 billion in 2022. While the full extent of this year’s deficit expansion would not be considered stimulus in a classic sense, it is clear the federal government took in a lot less cash than it sent out. Looking to 2024, we expect the federal deficit to narrow to a still very large 5.9% of GDP, reflecting a bit of belt-tightening on the spending side partly offset by higher interest outlays on government debt.\n",
    "5. Labor markets are showing signs of normalization to end 2023; unemployment could drift higher in 2024 while remaining low in historical context.\n",
    "Momentum in the job market is starting to wane with slowing payroll growth and modestly rising unemployment, as well as declining quit rates and temporary help. Increased labor force participation and elevated immigration patterns over the past year have added labor supply, while a shortening work week indicates moderating demand for labor. Considering the challenges to add and retain workers coming out of the pandemic, businesses could be more reluctant than normal to shed workers in a slowing economic environment. Even so, less hiring activity could be enough to cause the unemployment rate to tick up to the mid-4% area by the end of next year due to worker churn. Already slowing wage gains should slow further in the context of a softer labor market.\n",
    "6. Inflation trends are cooling, but likely to remain above the Fed’s 2% target through 2024.\n",
    "After reaching a four-decade high in 2022, inflation on both a headline and core basis has moderated significantly in 2023. Some categories have seen more improvement than others. For example, core goods inflation dropped from a peak of 12.4% in February 2022 to 0% in October 2023. Progress on core services inflation, which includes the sticky shelter category, has been slower. After peaking at 7.3% in February 2023, core services inflation was still running an elevated 5.5% in October 2023. We expect moderating shelter inflation in 2024 as the lag in market rents pricing should catch up in the inflation readings. We forecast core PCE prices—the Fed’s preferred inflation metric—to rise 2.4% in 2024, down from 3.4% in 2023.\n",
    "7. Housing sector activity has dropped 30%-40% over the past 18 months amid the surge in mortgage rates.\n",
    "With housing affordability metrics at a 40-year low, combined with 75% of mortgages locked in at 4% or below, the U.S. housing market is effectively frozen. Real residential investment tumbled at a 12% seasonally adjusted annual rate over the past six quarters. Meanwhile, home values rose 6% in 2023—to near all-time highs—amid tight supply and historically low vacancies. Given the already large drop in recent years, we think the housing market is one area of the economy that could perform better in 2024 than in 2023, even if trends remain soft in the near term.\n",
    "8. Supply chain bottlenecks are mostly in the rearview, while global supply chain restructuring will take time.\n",
    "Over the past year, as inventory constraints and shipping costs have fallen, supply chain considerations have shifted from short-term tactics to longer-term strategies of minimizing costs while ensuring resiliency. Legislation passed in 2022 including the CHIPS and Science Act and Inflation Reduction Act provides incentive for certain strategic industries—including semiconductors and renewables—to onshore production. This has resulted in rising business investment in high-tech manufacturing structures over the past year. Bigger picture, we expect global supply chain adjustments to continue at a conservative pace, as even the simplest changes are both costly and complex.\n",
    "9. Pressures on the commercial real estate sector are likely to intensify.\n",
    "The higher-for-longer interest rate environment and challenges among small and regional banks are resulting in tightening of lending standards and slowing slow growth. This is occurring across all loan types, but most acutely for the commercial real estate sector, where small and regional banks have meaningful exposure. With nearly $550 billion of maturing commercial real estate debt over the next year, losses are expected to mount for lenders and investors. While we do not expect this to be a systemic issue, reduced lending activity and potential investor losses could be an economic headwind.\n",
    "10. Geopolitical risks will remain top of mind.\n",
    "Elevated trade tensions with China, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and conflict in the Middle East all point to continued uncertainties and risks heading into 2024. While direct U.S. economic impact has been limited thus far, the larger risk is for a supply shock of a critical commodity or good—energy, food, semiconductors—that triggers significant market disruption. Next year’s U.S. presidential election could be more impactful than recent cycles on geopolitics given the backdrop of already elevated tensions.\n",

    "Whether you're renting your home out to guests, want to monitor your dog walker's comings and goings, or you're just tired of fumbling around with keys, a smart lock can add serious convenience to your life. The Assure Lock 2 from Yale is sleeker and smarter than the previous generation and supports Apple HomeKit on all models. It starts at $159.99 for a Bluetooth-only version, while the top-of-the-line touch-screen model with Wi-Fi goes for $259.99. No matter which you choose, the Assure Lock 2 lets you lock and unlock the door in multiple ways, create and manage access codes for guests, and view a timeline of door and lock activity. The $249 Ultraloq U-Bolt Pro Wi-Fi Smart Lock remains our Editors' Choice winner for its biometric fingerprint scanner, but the Assure Lock 2 is a strong competitor with a striking design. \n",
    " \n",
    "Sleeker and Smarter\n",
    "Ranging from $159.99 to $259.99, the Assure Lock 2 collection is made up of four models, which are up to 30% smaller than their predecessors.\n",
    " \n",
    "(Credit: Yale)\n",
    "The base models feature a keypad with physical buttons, though you can upgrade to a touch screen for $20 more. Each is available key-free or keyed, the latter of which features a mechanical key cylinder that works with a physical key. Key-free and keyed models cost the same. The Assure Lock 2 is available in three finishes: Black Suede, Oil-Rubbed Bronze, or Satin Nickel. \n",
    "All models work with the Yale Access app (available for Android, iOS, and watchOS) via Bluetooth and support Apple HomeKit. In the box with the Assure Lock 2 you also get Yale's DoorSense device, which uses a magnetic sensor to track when your door is open and closed. \n",
    " \n",
    "(Credit: Angela Moscaritolo)\n",
    "To control the lock beyond the limited Bluetooth range (about 30 feet), you need a Wi-Fi Smart Module, which inserts into the back of the lock and allows for remote management via the Yale Access app from wherever you are. For added convenience, the Wi-Fi Smart Module no longer requires a Wi-Fi Connect Bridge, so it's simpler to set up and doesn't occupy a wall outlet. Yale sells a version of the Assure Lock 2 with the Wi-Fi Smart Module preinstalled (starting at $239.99), or you can purchase it separately for $79.99 and add it to the lock yourself. \n",
    " \n",
    "Installing the Wi-Fi Smart Module (Credit: Angela Moscaritolo)\n",
    "For this review, Yale sent me the key-free, touch-screen Assure Lock 2 with Wi-Fi in Satin Nickel ($259.99). \n",
    "Yale also plans to launch Z-Wave and Matter Smart Modules (priced at $79.99 apiece), which should make it easier to integrate the Assure Lock 2 with your smart home ecosystem of choice. With a Wi-Fi, Z-Wave, or Matter Smart Module, the lock works with Airbnb and a wide variety of third-party security and automation systems, including Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Philips Hue, Ring, and Samsung SmartThings. \n",
    "The Assure Lock 2 collection fits on doors measuring 1-3/8 to 2-1/4 inches thick with a deadbolt bore hole of 2-1/8 inches (the standard size in the US) or 1-1/2 inches (commonly found in Canada), and a backset of 2-3/8 inches or 2-3/4 inches.\n",
    " \n",
    "Keep Extra Batteries on Hand\n",
    "Regardless of which model you choose, the lock is powered by four AA batteries, which are included in the box. Bluetooth-only locks should last between six and nine months before you have to swap out the batteries. Adding the Wi-Fi module, however, shortens battery life to just three months, Yale says. Battery life varies depending on use and other factors like Wi-Fi signal strength and the internal friction of your deadbolt. I burned through the batteries in my Wi-Fi-enabled unit in just seven weeks, but I locked and unlocked it dozens of times each day while working on this review. \n",
    "Unfortunately, the app doesn't display the battery level at all until it drops below 20%. When the batteries do reach that critical level, the Assure Lock 2 warns you via a notification in the app, a red light on the device itself, and an audible sound. I wish it pushed these alerts much sooner. In testing, I got locked out—during a torrential downpour while wearing just socks on my feet—before I received one of the low-battery warnings in the app. \n",
    " \n",
    "By the time I got a low-battery notification in the app, I was already locked out (Credit: Yale)\n",
    "If the batteries die and you get locked out, you can still open the door in one of two ways. With the keyed model, you can simply use the key. With the keyless model, you can use a standard 9V battery to power it from the outside. When I got locked out, I used the latter method (after my kind neighbor drove me to the store) and it worked. You simply place a 9V battery against the terminal on the bottom of the exterior keypad or touch screen, then the display should light up so you can type in your code to get in.  \n",
    " \n",
    "Powering the Assure Lock 2 from the outside with a 9V battery (Credit: Angela Moscaritolo)\n",
    "Changing out the batteries is simple: Just slide the battery cover off the interior lock, pull the ribbon to remove the old ones, insert the new ones, and reinstall the cover. \n",
    "A Yale spokesperson says the majority of buyers go with a keyed model because they want that physical backup for peace of mind. If the battery dies and you aren't carrying the key with you, you'll need to call a locksmith to get back in. The risk of getting locked out is actually lower with the keyless model because you can always grab a 9V battery at the store to power it back up. The choice is up to you, but I went with the key-free model for its more streamlined design and 9V battery backup option. \n",
    " \n",
    "Set Aside Some Time for Installation\n",
    "Most people should be able to install the Assure Lock 2 on most doors themselves with just a standard Phillips-head screwdriver, provided it fits in the place of your previous lock. Adjusting an existing door or prepping a new door for the Assure Lock 2 complicates the process and requires some additional tools, including a drill, a utility knife, a wood mortise chisel, a tape measure, and a level. \n",
    " \n",
    "(Credit: Angela Moscaritolo)\n",
    "As mentioned, if you've changed out a deadbolt lock in the past, you shouldn't have any problems installing the Assure Lock 2. I'm not adept at such tasks, so I enlisted my handy neighbor Ali, who has installed several smart locks of different brands in the past. \n",
    "Yale includes a written and illustrated installation guide in the box, and the Yale Access app can also guide you through the process. From start to finish, Ali completed the installation of my review unit in about two hours, though he notes he was taking his time. \n",
    " \n",
    "(Credit: Angela Moscaritolo)\n",
    "Installing the optional DoorSense device, which may require drilling a hole with a 5/8-inch paddle bit, as my door did, was the trickiest part. The DoorSense can be installed on wood or metal door frames.\n",
    " \n",
    "DoorSense installed (Credit: Angela Moscaritolo)\n",
    "In testing, I had no trouble pairing the Assure Lock 2 with its companion Yale Access app. If you're new to the app, you'll need to create an account, then verify both your email and phone number using one-time codes. Next, press Set Up a New Device and then use your phone's camera to scan the QR code on the lock (inside the battery compartment or on the quick start guide). \n",
    "After the app locates your device, it asks whether you want to view the installation instructions or begin setup. The first step of the process is to name your house in the app and specify which door the lock is on. Next, the app instructs you to open and unlock the door so it can calibrate the device. The calibration only takes a minute or so. Once complete, you should be able to control the lock through the app via Bluetooth. If you opt to use the DoorSense device it will also need to be calibrated, but this step is equally quick and easy. \n",
    " \n",
    "(Credit: Yale)\n",
    "If you have the Wi-Fi Smart Module, you need to enter your Wi-Fi password in the app to connect the lock to your home network. Note that the Wi-Fi Smart Module only supports the 2.4GHz frequency and doesn't work with 5GHz networks. \n",
    "During the setup process, the app prompts you to create the four- to eight-digit entry code you'll use to unlock the door. At this point, I created unique codes for myself, my neighbor, and my dog walker. When inviting others to use the lock, you can give them full app access or just a personal entry code. You can pick your own numbers to customize the codes so they're easy to remember. \n",
    " \n",
    "(Credit: Yale)\n",
    "The Yale Access app is simple and well organized, making it easy to manage your lock. The app features tabs at the bottom that let you quickly check your lock and door's current status, lock and unlock the deadbolt with a tap, view a timeline of lock and door activity, and create and manage access codes. \n",
    "In the app's Lock Settings menu, you can set up automations like Auto Unlock and Auto Lock, and enable Apple HomeKit so you can control the lock with Siri voice commands and Apple's Home app. Here, you can also enable Smart Alerts to be notified about certain events, like when the door is locked/unlocked manually, locked/unlocked by a specific user, left ajar, auto locked, or keypad locked. \n",

    "Going Keyless With the Assure Lock 2\n",
    " \n",
    "(Credit: Angela Moscaritolo)\n",
    "When not in use, the exterior touch screen turns off, so all you see is the Yale logo at the top. To unlock it with the touch screen, you simply tap the Yale logo, enter your code using the numbered buttons on the display, then tap the checkmark button. Neither I nor any of my guests with an access code had any trouble unlocking the door this way. The lock came in handy when I traveled to Berlin to cover the IFA consumer electronics trade show, allowing my dog walker to easily come and go twice a day to take care of my dog Bradley.\n",
    " \n",
    "(Credit: Yale)\n",
    "The Auto Unlock feature, which uses Bluetooth to detect when you are near to automatically unlock the door, is particularly useful—usually I'm still collecting things from my car when I hear it automatically unlocking. With notifications from the Yale Access app enabled, it sends an alert when it's automatically unlocking the door. That said, when used with the Wi-Fi module, the lock sometimes failed to automatically unlock in testing, in which case I had to type in the code to open the door. \n",
    " \n",
    "Controlling the Assure Lock 2 from an Apple Watch SE (Credit: Angela Moscaritolo)\n",
    "As mentioned, you can lock and unlock the Assure Lock 2 with one tap via the Yale Access app on your smartphone or Apple Watch, and this feature worked reliably in testing, but I almost never used it because the other methods are easier. \n",
    "The Wi-Fi Smart Module is a nice addition, but I wouldn't call it a must-have feature since I spend most of my time at home.

    " \n",
    "Controlling the Assure Lock 2 via Apple's Home app (Credit: Apple )\n",
    "In testing, I had no trouble connecting the Assure Lock 2 with several third-party smart home platforms, including Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit, and Google Assistant, via their respective mobile apps. I could then control and monitor the lock with voice commands such as \"Siri, lock my front door\" via a HomePod mini, \"Hey Google, what is the status of my front door\" via a Nest Mini, and \"Alexa, lock my front door\" via an Echo Show 8. \n",
    "\n",
    "Smart Looks and Functionality\n",
    "The Yale Assure Lock 2 can elevate the look of your door while adding convenience to your life. Ranging from $159.99 to $259.99, it offers a good variety to meet your needs, preferences, and budget, including keyless and keyed models with physical buttons or a touch screen. All models feature Bluetooth and work with the Yale Assure app and Apple HomeKit, and you have the option to add Wi-Fi connectivity for remote monitoring and control. Battery life for the Wi-Fi version could be better, but we otherwise have few complaints. The competing Ultraloq U-Bolt Pro Wi-Fi ($249) has the edge thanks to its fingerprint scanner, but the Assure Lock 2 is an excellent alternative, especially if minimal aesthetics strike your fancy. \n",
    "The Bottom Line\n",
    "The Yale Assure Lock 2 is a style-minded smart lock that makes it easy to go keyless and manage access to your front door while offering interoperability with many popular third-party smart home platforms.\n",
