**UBOX-AI:** Plug-and-Play AI Document Processing & Knowledge Machine for Every Business with Full Data Privacy

# What is it

UBOX-AI is an AI-powered machine designed to revolutionize document processing, simplify repetitive tasks, and boost productivity for small businesses and home offices. With UBOX-AI, you can bring the latest in artificial intelligence directly into your workspace with ease and efficiency.

- We believe in **"AI democracy"** - making AI accessible to all businesses, regardless of size. UBOX-AI is a showcase of how even a Small Language Model (SLM) can deliver powerful results, automating tasks and streamlining workflows that were once time-consuming and complex.

- For businesses intrigued by AI but concerned about cost, UBOX-AI is a **budget-friendly** solution that leverages open-source technologies. It allows companies to experience AI firsthand, without high upfront investments - afterall, we optimized the whole AI system to run under one 4090 (or even lesser) GPU of a game machine, single-digit (not double-digit) of thousands.

- UBOX-AI is also a **plug-and-play** solution, meaning it’s incredibly easy to deploy. Simply connect UBOX-AI to your company’s intranet, and it immediately serves as a web-based AI server. Employees can access AI tools securely through a browser, without the need for complicated setups or specialized software.

- Your data **privacy and security** are the top priority. UBOX-AI operates as a private deployment, ensuring that all AI processes run locally, keeping your business data secure and confidential while delivering the benefits of cutting-edge AI technology.
